"description" : "#AllHashtags is a newly created application. With it we can find, thanks to social networks api, and in real time, the best Hashtags for Social Networks.  Realizing a complete Hashtagging we will be able, without much difficulty, to win many likes for social networks by yawning our publications and using the right hastag at every moment.  Some say Hashtags, others Hastag and others Jachtac but after all what we are looking for is a system that allows us to grow our profile as quickly as possible and with the greatest possible interaction.  What #AllHashtags does is ask RRSS which tags have the most publications for each search and show them to you in a simple, organized and much more visual way than your own. Tagen we could call this functionality.  With the help of these tags we can get many more followers in our account due to the additional reach that each one of our images will have.  When performing a search among the most popular for each word we will know at all times what are the tags that we have to put in a publication. For example:  If we upload a picture of a kitten, we would have to look for kitten in the search engine of the app and we would get something like:  We can also use it to look for trends / trends within the social network. For, for example, when we want to build a new product around the network and know which one can work better than another.  We are very proud of the application that we define as Hashtags generator for Social Network that will make us grow followers / followers much faster in an intuitive and constant way, pointing to where we have to aim.  Boostea your profile, but now !, I do not know what youre waiting for ...  Disclaimer: This is not an official application or an application made by the company. This app is a tool that allows us to see data in a more comfortable way to help you, as a user. ",
