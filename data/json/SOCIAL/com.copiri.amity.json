"description" : "Amity allows Freemasons around the world to experience the Craft in real time. Finally, the power of modern technology is available to Masons.  Version 2.x of the Amity app includes:  - The ability to find Lodges around the world, contact the Secretary, and (if you are a verified member) get directions to the Lodge for your visit. Over 35,000 Lodges, in over 250 Grand Lodges around the world, are in Amity.  - The ability to check whether your Grand Lodge recognizes another Grand Lodge (whether they are in amity with each other). No more flipping through a book when your visitor arrives... now the the Tiler--or any Mason!--can get an answer in real time.   - The ability to check in to your Lodge for a meeting. This reduces the Secretarys workload: creating an attendance roster for the minutes is now as easy as clicking a button. As of version 2.5, you can also see your check in history.  - The ability to read a recent issue of MSAs Short Talk Bulletin. As of version 2.8, a rotating issue of the Bulletin, one of the most widely distributed Masonic publications in the world, is available to you at no cost.  Please let us know what you think -- you can always reach us at support@copiri.com. Thanks for using Amity! ",
