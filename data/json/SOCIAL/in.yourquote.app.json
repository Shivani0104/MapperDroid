"description" : "Hello there!   Since you have landed here, let me make it conversational. YourQuote Baba, the one wholl welcome you once you login, taught me that good writing is about starting a conversation & keeping the reader hooked.   The year was 2016. The month, October. I, much like you, accidentally landed on this description while searching for a writing app on Google Play. This app was merely a month old then. And I got hooked to it! Right from the start. It changed the way I saw and felt about writing. So much so that I joined the company and now am able to share my story with you. To share what YourQuote truly stands for. :)  In one line, YourQuote is an app that makes you write and never feel judged about it. It inspires you to find the most honest voice within yourself and takes care of your entire writing journey from getting started to getting better to publishing your book to making money off it. And it does so by taking care (rather, making sure) that you:  1. WRITE EVERYDAY: Yes, thats it. No bullshit. It will inspire you to write daily, teaching you techniques to become better and unleash the most honest voice within you. Its the only writing app youll ever need to keep the writer within you alive and kicking. Write from home, write from office, irrespective of whether you are working from home or office.  2.
