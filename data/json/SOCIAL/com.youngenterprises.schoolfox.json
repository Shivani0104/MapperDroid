"description" : "SchoolFox is the most advanced communication platform for schools.   Create a direct link to your students and their parents: Send important information or memories from the school day as text or photo messages from your smartphone or computer to the entire class, individual groups or specific parents.   Parents and students confirm the message with one click. Confirmations and receipts/cancellations instantly appear in your Signature list. The time-consuming review of the communication history is thus a thing of the past.   SchoolFox breaks down language barriers: recipients of a communication have the possibility to have them translated into 40 languages with one click. This helps you include relatives in the school day, which can not otherwise be accomplished due to a lack of language skills.   SchoolFox helps in an emergency: Parents and teachers can jointly create a student profile, which contains important information and contact details for emergencies. This profile is also available to you without internet connection.   SchoolFox protects your data: Communicate without having to exchange your private contact details. You decide yourself what information other users can see.   SchoolFox is not only for schools: Schoolfox is ideal for all organizations with group leaders/trainers/educators, where the leaders want to exchange information with the group members (or their parents) quickly, regularly and with minimal effort.
