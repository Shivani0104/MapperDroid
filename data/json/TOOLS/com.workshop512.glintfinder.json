"description" : "The #1 glint finder app on Google Play! Glint Finder uses the retro-reflection of the camera flash to allow the user to better identify shiny objects in the cameras field of view. Works great for locating hidden camera lens elements - also for finding dropped parts or contact lenses!  As mentioned in The Secrets to Finding Hidden Cameras at Techlicious.com - https://www.techlicious.com/tip/the-secrets-to-finding-hidden-cameras/  Glint Finder uses the same principle as the tools used by professionals to help search for and find the lens glint given off by hidden spy camera optics. - Set the devices flash rate in cycles per second (Hz). - Adjust devices flash duty cycle. - Toggle the image polarity to help highlight glints. The lens optics of hidden cameras produce specular reflection when illuminated with a flash. These retro-reflections show up as highlights or hotspots in the image that stand out as the flash toggles on and off. These are tell-tales used by skilled operators to sweep meeting areas and indoor rooms for hidden cameras.  Note: the flash rate and duty cycle capability will depend on your particular devices capability.  This is an ad supported app! Thanks for your feedback! ",
