Optional base 3-9 capability (replaces octal). Most calculators display only a single row of digits - this one displays five lines at once.  63-bit capability. Calculator functions AND, OR, XOR, NOT and Shift included. Copy and paste to clipboard.  It is designed for the buttons to be pressed on the screen - you cant use a hardware keyboard.  Android 4.03+. Screens normal or larger (does not support small screens). Full functionality both portrait and landscape on large screen tablet devices.  Now also displays ASCII. ",
