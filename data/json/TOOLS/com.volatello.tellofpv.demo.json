"description" : "*** This is not the full version but a demo for you to test compatibility before you buy ***  This is a free demo version of the TelloFPV app. It allows you to test if your particular phone and controller setup is compatible with TelloFPV before buying the full app.  Please consider this is a courtesy for you when rating the app, and rate fair according to functionality provided vs. what is present in the original Tello App.  If you are asking for obstacle avoidance, GPS, or a Gimbal please buy a full size drone.    Please read the PDF manual available under menu => help!   As a demo version it carries the following restrictions compared to the full app: * Max altitude is 2m * Only one photo is stored, overwriting previous photos * Only one set of photos for panorama stitching is stored * Only one short video is stored, overwriting previous videos * Expires after 10 flights, or 5 days after installation   If you are happy with what the app does please buy the full version.
