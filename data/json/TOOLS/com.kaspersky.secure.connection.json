HOW VPN WORKS  A VPN  which stands for virtual private network  creates a connection between your device and one of our servers, which are located in various locations all around the globe. Our VPN client lets you hide your IP address and actual location from intruders, and instead shows one of our IP addresses and a virtual location representing the country where the VPN proxy server youre connected to is located. It works like a proxy and therefore your real IP address wont show against the websites you visit  allowing you to browse anonymously. And whats more, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) will only see encrypted information  which all adds up to a your own mobile proxy you can trust to keep you safe wherever you go. In other words, with our VPN, private internet access is easier than ever.   Start your VPN download now to experience it for yourself.  This app uses Accessibility services. ",
