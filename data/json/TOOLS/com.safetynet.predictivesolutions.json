"description" : "The SafetyNet app from Predictive Solutions allows customers to predict, and ultimately prevent, workplace injuries. First, the app allows customers to conduct inspections and collect workplace safety observations from their job sites. Next, the app syncs these observations with the SafetyNet web application where advanced and predictive analytics are performed on the data. The SafetyNet predictive analytics helps customers identify where they are mostly likely to have a safety incident or injury, and then report and communicate that information to their work teams and management. This is a companion app for existing Predictive Solutions customers.
