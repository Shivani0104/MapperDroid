"description" : "The Bong Calendar - A Complete Bangla Calendar for your Android device.   The Calendar : Bong Calendar is just like the traditional Bengali Calendar . Only thing , it runs in android device and you can keep it in your pocket! It keeps you updated about the important days in Bangla and the Bengali Date.  Please note , you may have seen different Bengali Date for the same Gregorian Date in different news papers. It is because , in West Bengal we have two schools of Panjika Makers. One of them follow the old method (about 1500 years old!) the Surya Siddhanta and the others follow the Drik Siddhanta or Bishuddha Siddhanta method. For lunar day / or tithi timings , Bishuddha Siddhanta gives you accurate timing. We cover them both.    Widgets : We have home screen widgets that shhows current Bengali date. Two of them shows the time as well. And if you are residing outside of India , it shows you the current time in India for your location as well. Before you set it , it will ask for a preference , and select the Panjika you follow.   **Please note that the widget showing time might not work properly if you have a built in or third party task killer app. Please exclude Bong Calendar from your task killer app if the widgets are not working properly  We hope you will find this app useful and if you do , please share your review / ratings / scope of improvement areas / ideas . It is our continuous effort to make this application better with time.  For any assistance , please write to us . You can reach us at support@outscar.com . Our team will be happy to help you out.
