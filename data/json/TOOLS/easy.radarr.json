"description" : "A simple app designed to help you by managing your movie & shows library and easily adding new stuff to your radarr/sonarr system.  * Browse your entire movie library, or just check most recents downloads. * Browse your shows library, check out what episode are coming and which where downloaded recently. * Add wanted movies with one tap * Add wanted shows with one tap (all seasons, last season or only future shows; your choice!) * Want to watch an old episode again? Add the one you want easily by browsing the show  This may seem obvious but this app needs a running Radarr/Sonarr server, you wont be able to do anything with it since the app is just an interface.  You like the app? A positive rating is always welcome! You dont like the app? Please get in touch and let me know what could be improved :-)  Please report any bug and feel free to send me improvements ideas.  Logo & splashscreen by Alex P. (@acryllect sur twitter) ! Check it out ! ",
