"description" : "Using this app, you can create and share secret keys that you can then use to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vernam Cipher. This implementation acts as a one time pad as it discards the part of the key used to encrypt/decrypt messages.  Source code is available at https://github.com/jeffisaak/vernam_cipher  Changelog (from v1.1 onwards):  Version 1.10  - Upgraded Android SDK and Gradle versions. - Updated the about text.  Version 1.9: - Fixed a couple of bugs that were causing crashes  Version 1.8 - Added a message to the user indicating their password protected secret keys are broken (terribly sorry everyone)  Version 1.7 - Fixed a bug that was causing secret key importing to fail. - Fixed a bug that was causing password-protected secret keys to fail.  Version 1.6 - Fixed a bug that was causing the number of bytes remaining in a password-protected secret key to be misrepresented - Added the display of the cipher text when decrypting a message. - Added the ability to view a secret key (long press on a secret key in the list, then select View secret key).  Verison 1.5 - Fixed a bug that caused the app to crash when decryption was attempted with no secret keys generated  Version 1.4 - Fixed a bug that caused the app to crash on startup for new installations  Version 1.3 - Added ability to share encrypted messages as text or as a file - this opens up new sharing options - Miscellaneous code cleanup - Added a link to my donation page (yes, shameless self-promotion)  Version 1.2 - Fixed an error connecting to random.org  Version 1.1 - Fixed a rather crippling Nougat bug - Expanded the error message when random.org data fetching fails ",
