"description" : "Hash Calc is a tool for computing checksums of files and texts. After computation, the calculated hash values can be compared against other hashes for verifying data integrity.  Features::  Check all files within a directory, or even recursively over all its sub-directories.  A bookmark-tab for you to keep track of important results.  Export file checksums to text files, and compare exported text files to identify differences.  Fast, and efficient; optimized to process large files (ie. disk images).  Supported hash functions include the commonly used MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512).  --Free with no ads--  Permission Requests::  Storage Reading ~ to process files and compute checksums (obviously!).  Storage Writing ~ to export results as plain text files. ",
