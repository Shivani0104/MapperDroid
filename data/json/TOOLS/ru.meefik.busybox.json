For it is enough in any Android terminal to type the following command: export PATH=/data/data/ru.meefik.busybox/files/bin:$PATH  BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system.  REQUIREMENTS: * Device with architecture arm, arm64, x86, x86_64 * Android 4.0 (API 14) or later * Superuser permissions (root)  NOTICE: Forum: http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=694640 Developer site: http://meefik.ru Donations: http://meefik.ru/donate/  ATTENTION!
