"description" : "IPv4 subnets are used in order to expand the capacity of hosts and efficiently use one assigned IP.  This is a great tool for networking students as well as the network administrators who are working towards their certifications such as, CCNA, CCDA, CCNP, CCIE etc.  In networks having many unassigned IP addresses, a variable-length subnet mask (VLSM) can provide more efficient use of address space.
