"description" : "Samsung Users: Samsungs Android 10 update has broken many apps that work in the background, like Wakey. Im working on a new release to solve the problem they have created. If you want to try that version, please opt into the beta.  Have you ever wanted to keep your devices screen on longer than normal? Want to make your screen go to max brightness when you are using navigation or viewing your vacation photos? With Wakey, you can keep your screen on as long as you like.  Wakey keeps your screen on, on your terms - make the screen really bright, dim, or even completely dark - but the phones still awake and working. Wakey can also be set to keep your screen on when certain apps or games are active, or when the device is charging, or even when you are looking at the device.  Wakey is battery friendly - it will keep the screen awake only when you need it. You can enable it manually with the big bulb right in the app at any time, and tap it again or use the notification to disable it.  Note: Wakey might misbehave if task killers or battery savers are running. Xiaomi devices running MUIU 8 seem particularly unable (or unwilling) to be kept awake by any means, so I have removed support from most Xiaomi devices. If you happen to get it installed on one, and it doesnt work, please let me know at info@kanetik.com.  Wakey Premium (in-app upgrade) has several features that will make your life even easier:  FaceWake Keep your screen awake as long as you are looking at it.  AppWake Automatically keep your screen awake when certain apps are in the foreground.  ChargeWake Automatically keep your screen awake when its charging.  Tasker Plugin You can use Tasker or Locale to customize Wakey more than ever! Set Wakey to react to whatever triggers Tasker supports. Night-time browsing? Set the screen to remain on & dim. Using nav during the day? Set the screen on full brightness. You now have more control than ever! ",
