"description" : "Automagic Workarounds is a little helper app required to modify some settings with Automagic on Android 6 and later.  The app does not show up in the app drawer of your device since it does not have its own user interface. The app only serves as a helper for Automagic and does not have any purpose without the main Automagic app. ",
