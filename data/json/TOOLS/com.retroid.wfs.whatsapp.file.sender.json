"description" : "IMPORTANT: Both sender and receiver must have WhatzApp and WFS: WhatzApp File Sender apps installed on their phones to send and receive files.   FEATURES OF WFS 2:    SEND ANY TYPE OF FILE: With WFS 2 you can send any type of file, like pdf, apk, doc, avi, doc, txt, exe, etc, etc. through the official WhatsApp app (which by default allows you to send only audio and video files).   SEND MULTIPLE FILES AT A TIME: Unlike WFS, with WFS 2 you can send more than one file at a time. Be it 2 files or 100 files.   SEND FILES OF SIZE UP TO 150 MB: WhatzApp has file sending limit of only 16 MB, which is way too less. But WFS allows you to send files of up to a size whooping 150 MB.    AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION: Files received by the recipient are automatically extracted and saved to the phone, no need to manual extraction like in WFS 1.   SEND PHOTOS WITHOUT ANY LOSS IN QUALITY: When you send any photo through WhatsApp, WhatzApp reduces its quality by resizing and re-encoding it. But with WFS, you can send photos without any loss in quality. Not a single byte of original photo is altered.  Disclaimer: We have no relationship with WhatzApp messenger and its related trademarks in any way. WhatzApp is the property of WhatzApp Inc. ",
