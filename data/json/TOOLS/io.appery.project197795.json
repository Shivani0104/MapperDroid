"description" : "The ILS Toolkit provides formulas and information for Instrument Landing System Technicians and Engineers.  It simplifies the calculations required for many ILS system adjustments and provides a quick reference to useful information that is difficult to find in technical manuals especially when working in an outdoor airport environment.  Some of the tools include: Width adjustment, Localizer Null Cutting, Glide Slope antenna heights/offsets, antenna phaser zeroing, distribution magnitude/phase, conversion, and much more...  Issues:  Some Samsung devices do not display the decimal point on the numeric keyboard. For now I recommend downloading the free SwiftKey keyboard from Google Play. Its easy to switch back and forth between keyboards. ",
