"description" : "This application is a plugin for Yatse.  When this application is installed, you can activate this plugin for your Media Center and directly manage volume of your compatible UPnP receiver from Yatse.  No more need for a separate application or hardware remote even when using pass-through mode in Kodi.  Please note that most UPnP receivers will not allow volume control when not playing something on their UPnP interface.  HELP AND SUPPORT  Official website: https://yatse.tv  Setup and usage documentation: https://yatse.tv/wiki  FAQ: https://yatse.tv/faq  Community forums: https://community.yatse.tv  Please use website or email for support and feature requests, as comments on Play Store do not allow to gather enough information or contact you back.  NOTES  Once installed you need to select the plugin for the needed host and configure it. (See https://yatse.tv/faq/plugin-issues)  You need to have purchased the Unlocker to use receiver plugins.
