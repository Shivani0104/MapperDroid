"description" : "An advanced Smart Metal Detector application which detects the presence of metallic and magnetic objects nearby by measuring the intensity of magnetic field value using your smartphone built-in magnetic field sensor. If your device does not contain one then this application will not work.  The measured intensity of the magnetic field will be display by magnetic field level in T (microtesla). The magnetic field level (EMF) is the magnetic field intensity generated by metallic objects. In nature it is about 49T(microtesla) or 490mG(milli gauss); 1T = 10mG. That means if a metal is detected nearby the phone, the application will show the value of it in real-time and the intensity of it will show how strong is the metal and how nearby it is.  Smart Metal Detector is a portable metal detector that lets you identify any metal object in area because all metals generate a magnetic field whose strength can be measured with this tool. By detecting nearby electromagnetic fields using the built-in magnetometer, you can locate nearby metal and magnets for research, you can find a hidden security camera for your safety. You can also use the app in finding metallic studs of steel and iron alloys wiring inside the walls.  To start using it just launch this application and start to move the phone around. You will start noticing a rise in the magnetic field which is set to default at natures default magnetic field level. The magnetic field level shown on the screen will constantly fluctuate with the movement. Three colorful lines represent the strength of the magnetic field level (EMF). When the max value is reached meaning a metal is found, the device will vibrate and make a sound. In settings, you can change the sensitivity of vibration and sound effects.  Use it as a stud finder to find electrical wires in walls, iron pipes on the ground, have fun with it and use it as a ghost detector to scare someone!  The accuracy of the measurement depends on the sensor in your mobile device. NOTE: Due to electromagnetic waves, the magnetic sensor might get affected by electronic equipment. The metal detector cannot detect non-ferrous materials like gold, silver, and coins made by copper. ",
