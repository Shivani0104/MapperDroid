"description" : "PO Contacts stands for Privacy Oriented Contacts.  The vision and end goal of this project is to have a portable and privacy oriented contacts manager.  - Portable means you can use it on any platform (see supported platforms on the website) - Privacy oriented means its built with a privacy first mindset. See the privacy policy for details.  Disclaimer  I built this app on my free time and mostly as a learning experience. I intend to use it myself and Im happy to share it publicly for free if it can help others. I also made the code available publicly, because I believe being open source is an important part of a privacy-focused app. That being said, if you choose to use it, you use it at your own risks, there is no warranty (see the licence for more details).  Features: - Create and edit contact details - Start email from contact - Start phone from contact - Start SMS from contact - Export contacts to .vcf files - Import contacts from .vcf files - Protect your exported files with password-based AES encryption ",
