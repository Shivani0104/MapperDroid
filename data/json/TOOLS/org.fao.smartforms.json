"description" : "SmartForms: Support to data collection programs is a mobile data collection platform to collect and review fishery and observer data (hereinafter SmartForms). With one platform, SmartForms can serve data collection in different sectors. The application will remain the same, but data can be collected using various data collection templates that are customized to  satisfy the needs related to specific data collection project(s)/survey(s) (the Forms). The aim is to enable a data manager to define the Forms in a few steps and automatically have the Forms updated on the data collectors devices. The SmartForms App promises to deliver cost-effective and accurate support to data collectors with a particular focus on fisheries scientific observers.  The collection of data in the field is a cornerstone of scientific and monitoring activities, and needs to rely on a robust infrastructure to collect, validate, amend, archive and share data. Current data collections typically rely on workflows where data may be misplaced (e.g. Excel files), difficult to maintain or understand (reference data) or reconcile (local installations), require extensive manual processing (validation and exchange), and/or have a single-focus implementation (e.g. support for only one reporting protocol).  In addition to being a generic data survey platform, the SmartForms App offers integration of domain specific Master Data Management and reference data such as species or country lists, which improves data harmonization.
