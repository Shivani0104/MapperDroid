"description" : "Grapher is a fast and effective equation plotter, capable of drawing any function, solving equations and calculating expressions. Especially if youre a student, teacher or engineer, this app is made with you in mind! A wide range of predefined functions is available, including trigonometric & hyperbolic functions, polar coordinates, differentiation and more. Anything you type will be processed and displayed instantly by a powerful math engine, in both 2D and 3D modes. Furthermore, functions can reference each other by their name.  As I strive to make Grapher fit your needs, any feedback and bug-reports are greatly appreciated. This free version is ad-supported; please consider buying Grapher Pro to remove all ads and enjoy extra features!  Curve types  Function (e.g. parabola, sine wave)  Polar (e.g. rose, spiral)  Parametric (e.g. ellipse, Lissajous) on the xy-plane or r-plane  Implicit equation (e.g. conic sections)  Implicit inequality (e.g. half-plane)  3D function (e.g. paraboloid)  3D parametric curve (e.g. helix)  3D parametric surface (e.g. sphere, hyperboloid)  More features  Equation solver (numerical)  Find roots, extrema and intersections with other functions  Functions can reference each other, e.g. g(x)=2*f(x+1)  Custom math keyboard  Auto-detect input type  User variable support for both numbers and functions  Adjustable parameter range (for cartesian, polar & parametric curves)  Input history  Plot up to 28 graphs at once  Differentiation (numerical)  Trace graph  Capture screenshots  Note: Mathematical functions should be typed by their names, for example sqrt(x) means x. Hold a key to see all function names starting with that letter. If something is unclear, be sure to check out the Help page as all details are summarized there. ",
