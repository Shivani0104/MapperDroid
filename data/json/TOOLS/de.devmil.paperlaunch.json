"description" : "PaperLaunch is a side launcher. Tired of hopping back to your home screen to launch that one app while you are inside another one? Have you used a side launcher and  * are frustrated because you have to do multiple gestures to launch the app? * activate it accidentally by touching the activation zone and immediately launch the app that happens to be on that spot? * do you miss the ability to define a folder structure in that launcher?  Then PaperLaunch is the perfect side launcher for you. Try it!  PaperLaunch is open source! You can find it on GitHub. ",
