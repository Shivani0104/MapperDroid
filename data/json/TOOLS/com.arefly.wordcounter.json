"description" : "Words Counter Tools is a simple but useful tool. Simply type in and the app will automatically count the number of words, characters, sentences and paragraphs as you type. You can also copy and paste a document you have already written into Word Counter Tools and it will display the counting result for that piece of writing.  Language supported for counting: - English (Actually most languages separated words by space   are abled to count in this App) - Simplified Chinese  - Traditional Chinese   We promise to keep working on Word Counter Tools and make it better. If you have any questions or suggestions for this app, feel free to contact developer at eflyjason@gmail.com. We will try our best. Thanks! :)  Disclaimer: We strive to make Word Counter Tools as accurate as possible but we cannot guarantee it will always be so. ",
