"description" : "This is a great, simple spirit level combined with a compass.  The rotation in horizontal position can be measured with the compass. The precision of the compass depends on your sensor. Magnets and electric fields have a magnetic field and thus have an influence on the compass.  * Set your own layout color * Three different display modes with spirit level and/or compass * Easy calibration of the spirit level * Angle with or without decimal place * Visual feedback when angle is equal to 0 (optional) * Swap x and y axis * Choose between landscape and portrait mode * Display can be kept active * Application can be moved to SD card  PRO VERSION: To remove ads and to customize the visual feedback range, you can purchase Spirit Level & Compass Pro in the Play Store.
