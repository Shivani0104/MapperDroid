"description" : "Internet Optimizations App is here to help you get the most juice out of your internet connection, as well as better performance on apps that are internet-dependent. It attempts to provide a lag free experience.  Disclaimer We CANNOT change how strong is your signal or how fast is the internet speed your ISP provides, but what we can do is to prepare your device and help it take advantage of every available resource. The app performs actions and run commands that you could probably perform manually, but we simplified all the process and added custom patches so you can start optimizing with only one click.  Optimization levels We provide different optimization levels depending on whether your device is rooted or not, and its Android version. If you are not sure about this, the app will automatically detect and determine the best profile for your device.  Root profile optimizations are the most extensive and includes internal network settings such as MTU size, buffer size, ttll hops, and more tweakings for wifi, lte, gprs, 3g, hsupa, hspa, edge, evdo and umts connections. You will have the option to make a backup of your default settings before proceeding, as a measure for maximum safety so you can revert anytime if you want. Non-root profile optimizations mostly focus on improving the device performance in real time by temporarily suspending secondary processes traffic consumption. No backup is required since no permanent changes are made. Non-root optimizations will also be applied on root access profile. ",
