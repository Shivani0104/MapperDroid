"description" : "Periodically allows you to track periodic events that repeat after an undetermined number of days, like for example:  - Events that repeat periodically but beyond your control. - Things you do from time to time but without a fixed repetition cycle.   PREDICTIONS  The app will predict the dates when your events will happen again. The more occurrences you track, the more accurate the predictions will be.   REMINDERS  Periodically can remind you when an event is about to happen again or when the event is late.   STATISTICS  The app will show detailed statistics about your periodic events. This will allow you to see how each event is affecting your life and act accordingly.   YOU ARE IMPORTANT  Periodically is still young and for that reason we need your support. If you like it and find it useful please leave us a nice review, it really helps. And if you have any suggestions let us know too, wed love to hear them!  Thanks a lot! ",
