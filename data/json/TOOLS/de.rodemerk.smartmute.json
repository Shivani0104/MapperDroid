"description" : "SmartMute is an app, which makes your life a little bit easier: Place your device with the screen downwards (e.g.: in front of you on a table). SmartMute switches it automatically to the mode youve chosen (vibration /or silent mode). So, you can keep busy with something else without that your device disturbs you with sounds.     Pay attention, please:  SmartMute was designed for that you are not be disturbed by your device with sounds or incoming calls e.g.: during a conversation. So, if you take the device in hand for an incoming call, it rings.  With some devices (e.g.: some of Samsungs models), it might be happen, that the device utters a sound, if you take it again in hand. This sound is system-oriented and not part of the this application.  SmartMute uses the devices orientation sensor. If the device is with the screen downwards and in a horizontal position, the vibration /or silent mode is activated. This can also happen mistakenly if youre having your device in the trouser pocket and sitting or riding a bike. For that, deactivate SmartMute with the slide control for this period of time. ",
