"description" : "No ads. aRhoAIR is a state point psychrometric air properties calculator to find air density, specific heat, various vapour pressure, dew point temperature, moisture content, enthalpy, etc. It is specially developed by a professional engineer to replace the psychrometric chart. aRhoAIR will change the way you normally find air properties, air density and specific heat by using conventional psychrometric chart.  - input options - RH or Twb.  - input options - Z (altitude) or P (pressure) with units selection (Pa, hPa, kPa, mbar, bar, in.Hg, psi, atm)  - calculation formulation based on ASHRAE guidelines.  - in SI & IP units.  - save result function with built-in result file viewer.   for detail and worked example, see https://sites.google.com/view/pocketengineer/android-os/rhoair-free-and ",
