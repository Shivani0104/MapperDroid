"description" : "Switch your Play Store to dark mode!  This is an unofficial app that changes the style of your Play Store to a black theme. It already works in Android 10, but all older phones were left out ... until now! This app enables dark mode even on Android 6, 7, 8 or 9!  If you like this app, check out our dark theme for Instagram: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ribbyte.darkmode.ig  Frequently asked questions:  How do I activate the dark mode? -> Start the app. Click on the Toggle Dark Mode button on the bottom. After you watch a short ad, the dark mode will be activated and your Play Store should start.  It doesnt work! -> Unfortunately, some vendors are not supported yet. This is outside of our control.   How do I turn dark mode off? -> The same way you turned it on: click on Toggle Dark Mode. Wait a few seconds until everything reloads. If it doesnt work, try rebooting your phone.  I uninstalled the app but everything stayed black! -> You uninstalled it without disabling dark mode first. Install our app and click on Toggle Dark Mode. If it doesnt work, try rebooting your phone.  Do you have any suggestions or questions?
