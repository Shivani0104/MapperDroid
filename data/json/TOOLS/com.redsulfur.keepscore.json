"description" : "Parents, umpires, officials, and referees... keep score at all of your sporting events and games with this score keeper app designed like a scoreboard. It is specifically designed to work for baseball, football, basketball, soccer, hockey, rugby, and tennis, but it also has a generic mode where it can be used to keep score for just about any sport.   http://facebook.com/keepscorepro  Want to keep track of the time also? Just use the built-in stopwatch or countdown timer.  Simple controls... just touch the score or period to increase the score or press-and-hold to decrease the score. Edit the team names to customize it for your game by doing a press-and-hold on the team names. Want more control over changing the score? Check out the setting to show the extra scoring buttons.  You can even set it to keep the screen on during the game.  Game data is always saved when you exit, so you will never lose the score by accidentally closing the app.  Share your scores to email, text, or your favorite note taking app.  Change font sizes on the fly for easy adjusting for different size screens.  Purchase the in-app premium features: * set your own colors and fonts * auto-text selected contacts on score changes * adds score history * share full score history * adds option to display timer in tenths of seconds * take notes during games ",
