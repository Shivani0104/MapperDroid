VRMark works with Daydream View and Google Cardboard compatible headsets, but a headset is not required to run the tests.   Amber Room benchmark Use the Amber Room benchmark to test and compare the peak performance of current and next-generation smartphones. The Amber Room test is very demanding for first-generation Daydream devices. Dont be surprised if frame rates are low.  Purple Room benchmark Use the Purple Room benchmark to see if your device can run VR content for a longer period without heating up or slowing down. Some phones will get hot when running this test, and their performance may fall as the test runs.  Experience Mode VRMark includes three free-roaming VR experiences with different levels of complexity. Connect a headset and use Experience Mode to see how well your device compensates for missed frames. Experience mode works with Daydream View and Google Cardboard compatible headsets.
