"description" : "Meteors speed test checks your internet connection over WiFi and mobile data connections on 3G & 4G/3G, 4G/LTE & 5G connections to help you better understand your internet speeds. As well as understanding how internet connection affects video and music streaming, gaming and browsing. Meteor also shows you how your mobile internet connection is affecting the performance of your favorite apps.  - Speed Test for 3G, 4G and 5G Internet Connections Meteors internet speed test allows you to understand if the connection speed of your mobile network operator is directly affecting the features of your mobile apps. Monitor and test network speed and app performance scores for up to six mobile apps at a time, from 25 of the most popular apps around the world.  Many mobile apps today require a consistent mobile internet connection and fast download speed to perform optimally. Meteors download speed test, upload speed test and ping test give you complete clarity on how your mobile connection is impacting video streaming, music streaming and mobile gaming.  - Easy to Use Speed Test One simple speed test gives you easy-to-understand results on download speed and upload speed (in Mbps) and the ping time performance (in milliseconds). Then, simply choose the apps you use most to see how they are impacted by your current network connection, download speed and upload speed - no more trying to work out if your 3G, 4G/LTE or 5G internet speed is good or not!  - Historic Speed Test Performance View all of your speed tests by location on a map and sort them by best and worst speed performance. See a timeline of your speed tests in the test history tab and review the stats for each speed test to monitor how your network experience has changed over time.   - Improving Network Connectivity We provide an independent source of truth in mobile network experience: A data source that shows how users experience mobile network speeds, gaming, video and voice services worldwide. To do this, we collect data on the signal strength, network, location and other device sensors. You can stop this at any time in the settings. We share this data with network operators globally and others in the industry to drive better connectivity for all.  - Supported Apps for Speed Testing Meteor supports performance and speed tests on 25 apps: Chrome, Dropbox, Amazon, Facebook, Flipboard, Gmail, Google Maps, Instagram, Skype, Spotify Music, Google Street View, Twitter, Uber, Waze, WhatsApp, YouTube, Pokemon Go, Clash Royale, Critical Ops, Mobile Legends, Super Mario Run, Netflix, Telegram, Tunein and Messenger.
