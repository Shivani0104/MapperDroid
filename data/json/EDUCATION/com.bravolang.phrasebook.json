"description" : "The Travel Phrasebook app has many useful foreign phrases and words (e.g., Thank you!, How much? or A table for two, please!). When you tap a phrase, the app speaks it aloud. There is no guessing as to how to pronounce the words. And if the app is talking too quickly for you, simply tap the snail icon to hear the words more slowly. Listen to pronunciation recorded by native speaker and then record and play back your own voice to practice your foreign language speaking skills!  When traveling to foreign countries, make sure you bring the app with you! Ideally you listen to a phrase and repeat it, but if your accent is terrible, you can play the voice on the app to local people (e.g., a waiter or store clerk). Language barrier while travelling abroad will no longer exist!  FEATURES   - Many useful foreign phrases & words - Pronunciation recorded by native speaker - Voice recording & playback - No Internet connection required - Instant search by keywords - Customizable font size  Welcome to download the Travel Phrasebook app! Easily learn foreign language phrases & words including English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Turkish, Portuguese, Greek, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, and Hindi!
