"description" : "*Free with no ads*  The Russian Made Easy app uses modern techniques like contextual learning, construction branching, and pattern recognition for grammar and multiple native speakers.  This is the app version of the Russian Made Easy podcast and course that teaches beginners to speak and understand Russian in a fun, efficient style.  With thirty episodes in all, each episode approximately 20 mins long, the course could be finished in a week, but its best to study only one episode per day.  This app is ideal for absolute beginners to Russian, as well as those with some experience but who just havent been able to find the right course. ",
