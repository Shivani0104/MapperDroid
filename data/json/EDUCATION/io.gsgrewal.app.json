"description" : "CBSE made a major change in the testing (Examination) pattern from the Academic Session 2019  20. It will test the students, to a large extent, on the basis of Objective Type Questions and Multiple  Choice Questions.  CBSE has declared that 25% i.e., 20 Marks Question Paper will be Objective Type Questions and Multiple  Choice Questions. Thus, a Question Paper will have 20 Questions of 1 (one) mark each and 75% i.e., 60 Mark Question Paper will be on the lines of examinations held in the past.  It is said When Why is clear, How becomes clear.  This saying has become true due to the change in the Question Paper pattern. Henceforth, students will have to have their concepts clear. It will also help them to perform well in other aspect of their Examination Paper.  In our endeavour to consistently assist the teaching fraternity and also the students, keeping the above objective in mind, about 1500 Objective Type Questions and Multiple  Choice Questions have been framed. Not only the questions have been framed but along with it reason for the answer being correct is given so that the student has clarity as to Why the answer is correct. We are sure that the teachers and students both will benefit from this effort of ours.  The website can be used by registering on the website following a simple process. The questions will be before the user in the form of Test of 20 questions with a time limit for each test. Immediately after the test, result of the user will be displayed. User can view the result along with the reasons for the answers. Questions will be selected by the system randomly.  User has the liberty to take as many tests as he or she desires. We urge the teachers and students to make best use of the contents of the website and score well in the examination. We will continuously add more and more questions. Currently, the Objective Type Questions and Multiple  Choice Questions cater to the requirements of Class XII alone but in coming times questions for Class XI will also be posted. ",
