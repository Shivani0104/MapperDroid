"description" : "Created by the team at PebblePad, the nifty PebblePocket app allows you to continue to create evidence, reflections, and records even when an internet connection is proving elusive. You can use the app to work offline and your assets will synchronise automatically with your PebblePad account whenever you next have an internet connection.   Supports the recording of the following asset types:  * Blog Posts * Reflections (Journal Entry - What? So What? Now What? - Structured Reflection) * Experiences (Activity - Competency) * Photos * Videos  By associating your account with PebblePocket you can also easily setup one-click launch into your account.  Please note:  1. To get the most from PebblePocket it should ideally be used alongside a PebblePad account (this can be a personal or organisational account). You can learn more about personal accounts on the PebblePad website. See Solutions > Buy a personal account  2. The PebblePocket app is currently not available for all organisations because of the authentication methods in place.  3. The sending of assets is currently a one way process  any records created in the app and then sent to a PebblePad account will no longer be editable from within the app.   For additional help and support, checkout:  Our help guide at http://bit.ly/1jeUurq Our FAQs at http://www.pebblepad.co.uk/pp3help/faq ",
