"description" : "Oil & Gas Dictionary. In this application, I gathered more than 13 000 words used in petroleum and natural gas industry. Drilling Engineers, Petroleum Production Engineers, Reservoir Engineers can benefit from this app. The app is not only beneficial for Petroleum and Natural Gas engineers and students but also Chemical Engineers and Geophysics Engineers can use the app. We tried to build the app with slick design and hope you all love it.  Additionally, I placed a Unit Converter that helps you in your calculations. Units are based on 6 categories:  - Basic - Gas - Fluid - Force and Power - Drilling - Production  If you have feature request or an idea you think would be awesome to see in the app, please reach me out via tech.omega@outlook.com   If you enjoy using the app, consider supporting me via in app purchases.  Thanks for using the app. ",
