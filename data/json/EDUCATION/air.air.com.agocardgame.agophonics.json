Each phoneme target has three high frequency word examples.   Four levels graded by difficulty (Aqua, Green, Orange, Purple).   Set voice to male, or female.  Useful on its own, or alongside bestselling AGO Phonics card games (first or second edition), to reference the pronunciation of words on the cards.  Great for classroom and home use!  Aqua level is completely free. Upgrade to access all features of the other three levels, and one super sound board, containing all 140 targets (over 425 vocab items total)!   AGO Q&A Aqua sound pad is also included free. (includes 36 simple Q&A questions and 200 vocab items to practice). Content matches the bestselling AGO Phonics card games series, making its content quick and easy to reference. For EFL / ELT learners, the app offers an easy way to quickly reference and hear unknown words pronounced by native speakers (which can otherwise be difficult for students to do outside the classroom).  Parents and adult students with a lack of confidence in their own English pronunciation can also benefit from using this app and AGO cards as a way to learn the sounds of English. The AGO Phonics sound pad goes far beyond the ABCs - over four levels, over 140 of the most common phonemes and word families used in the English language are covered- including consonant blends, digraphs, r controlled vowels, diphthongs, long vowel sounds, silent letters and more!
