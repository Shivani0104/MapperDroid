You can then listen to the sentence and read its translation.  Repetition is the key to learning. Therefore, 1 to 5 stars are associated with each level in order to encourage you to replay them and get 5 stars without making any mistakes.  A GAME WHICH ADAPTS TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE Each level has 5 rules to remember. An algorithm automatically determines the rules which you may already know or not know, and chooses the type of mistake at each step to show it to you, giving priority to those that you have not yet acquired. When the algorithm determines that you have mastered a rule, you earn a star.
