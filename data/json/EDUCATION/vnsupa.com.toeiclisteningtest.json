"description" : "You can improve my English pronunciation as well as learn how to start a conversation or end it. It also can remove your anxiety to talk with others, some kind of confidence. Moreover, its free with some add popping up in between. Overall, five star worthy app for those who want to develop their English pronunciation.  This is the best english speaking practice app i have ever seen. It has provided recording option , practice potion and listening option. If you need to improve your listening skill you can use listening option. If you need to improve your speaking skill you can use practice option.  Best app to practice your speaking skill. All of the speakers made it slower so it would be clear and easy to imitate. Hope you will upload sooner more conversation as if they are speaking normal at different scenarios.  They show only one add when you start or finish a conversation. Other thing that I like was all the conversation are like real life. So you get a lot of words, how to pronounce where to stop and how much pause you should give in between sentences In my opinion this is a 5star as it is free as well. Everyone can just download and use it. ",
