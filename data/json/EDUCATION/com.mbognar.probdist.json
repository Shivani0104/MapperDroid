"description" : "Compute probabilities and plot the probability mass function for the binomial, geometric, Poisson, hypergeometric, and negative binomial distributions. Compute probabilities, determine percentiles, and plot the probability density function for the normal (Gaussian), t, chi-square, F, exponential, gamma, beta, and log-normal distributions.  Some knowledge of probability distributions is required! If you dont know what a binomial distribution is, for example, this application will not be useful to you. ",
