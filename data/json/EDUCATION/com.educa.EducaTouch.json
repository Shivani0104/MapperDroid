"description" : "Educa Touch keeps families in touch with whats happening at their childs education service, and encourages a shared understanding of the childs learning. The Educa Touch app requires an Educa account to log in.  What is Educa? Educa is a web-based portfolio of a childs growth and learning development. It allows parents and early childhood teachers to share a childs journey and gain valuable feedback. It is built with recommendations from early childhood teachers and parents.
