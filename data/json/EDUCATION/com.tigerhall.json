"description" : "Almost all of us have certain life goals we want to achieve or aspirations we are looking to realize. Yet we dont have access to the people who have already done what we dream of doing, let alone the ability to learn directly from them and their success. Insights like the mistakes theyve made, how they maintain their success and the key actions you need to take today to get closer to your goals.   What if you had a truly 21st century university in your pocket, teaching you actionable ideas that are actually relevant to your life in year 2018, and all the professors were the current number 1s in their respective fields?   The world is evolving rapidly and its time we do too. Weve been learning from the people who know but its time to learn from the people who do. Founded in 2018, Tigerhall now connects thousands of ambitious learners worldwide to the insights from hundreds of experts via in-person events, podcasts, e-books and personal mentoring sessions.   Tigerhall brings actionable advice and insights from the most successful people in industry today to some of the most ambitious future leaders of tomorrow. ",
