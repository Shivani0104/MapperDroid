"description" : "Memory Ladder is a simple tool for those interesting in memory training. This version will help you train in number memorization.  You can control: * Number of digits to memorize * Time alloted to memorize * Grouping of Digits  This is a redesign of Memory Ladders number memorization challenge. This version is simpler and much more user friendly. My hope is that it is just as effective as a training tool.  This version of Memory Ladder has many improvements: * Decluttered the interface * Setting configurations can be saved * Black text on white background and no grid lines * More spacing between digits and rows * Current position is highlighted * Can recall line by line or all at once * The app works in both portrait and landscape * You can leave the app and come back without having to start over * After submission of recall you go straight to review  If you have any comments or concerns send an email to mastersofmemorycontact@gmail.com ",
