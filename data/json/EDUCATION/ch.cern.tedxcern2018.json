"description" : "TEDxCERN has evolved into a platform dedicated to share ideas and initiatives from scientific, technological, educational and artistic fields that have inspired awe from an expanding audience. Our ambition is to curate a programme each year which breaks the boundaries of academia, talks which have the power to make us question the very basis of science and have the potential to change the way we think, behave and act.  We broke onto the TEDx scene in 2013, captivating our audience under the theme of Multiplying Dimensions. The following year we expanded our audience and online reach with FORWARD: Charting the future with science. And by the time we reached our 2015 event Breaking the Rules, TEDxCERN had reached a crescendo of momentum leading us to create Ripples of Curiosity in 2016.  And were not slowing the momentum down. This November we will engage with The Elephant in the Room, and explore the kind of transformative scientific innovation that is impacting the world we live in. Speakers and leaders in their field will give us an insight into waves of evolution. ",
