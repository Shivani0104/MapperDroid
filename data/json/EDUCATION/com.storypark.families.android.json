"description" : "Storypark for Families is designed for parents and their family. Help your child reach their unique potential in a private community of people who love and care most.    Do you wonder what your child is doing when youre not there? With Storypark, educators can send you stories, photos, videos and messages while they work with your child.  Record your childs most precious moments in your very own interactive, fun-filled album, and tell the story of the most important little person in your life. Grab a quick photo or get creative with layouts, stickers, filters and overlaid text that really tell the whole story.  Notify a family member, the whole family or your childs educators when youve got something to share and they can respond with words or video messages.  Observe progress and relive treasured memories with your child through your timeline.  Explore a growing video library of fun learning activities you can do with your child.  Your memories are stored safely in the cloud so family members can privately view them from anywhere in the world.   Enjoyed by families in 150 countries and thousands of leading early childhood services around the world.   Awesome resource, thank you for making it free and so easy to use! The design is a joy to navigate. Today was my Grandsons first day at Kindy and how lucky am I to be at work but still see the expressions on his face on his first day!! Just magic!!
