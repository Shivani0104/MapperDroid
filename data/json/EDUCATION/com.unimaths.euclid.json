"description" : "This application teaches how to calculate GCD of two numbers by Euclidean Algorithm and express GCD as a linear combination of two numbers. This app differs from other apps in the following way: 1. Gives step by step solution for GCD as well as linear combination. 2. The linear combination is done in a very simple way. Just go through tutorial. Genearlly students calculate GCD but finds it difficult to express it as a linear combination. The app will definately help to overcome this. 2. Supports very large numbers (Try it!). Report any bugs to univrmaths@gmail.com or write them in reviews. Rate our App if you like! ",
