"description" : "This application is all in one package, that supports all types of conversion, calculation as well as ASCII translation.   It supports all four number systems: Binary, Decimal (Denary), Octal and Hexadecimal, and can convert from one base to another. Also, calculations can be performed on all these bases.  Furthermore, this app has functionality for twos complement as well as normalized mantissa exponent binary representation. This feature is mostly useful for Cambridge A-levels students to check their result after calculation. You can now easily convert from binary to denary or vice-versa, using this tool. Further notes are available under developer notes in the app.  Inputs can be pasted and results can be copied.   Full features:  -> Supports all four number systems and four basic operations. -> Easy to use  -> Supports negative numbers as well as floating points -> Ad-free -> Can perform conversions from decimal floating to normalized floating point, i.e. Mantissa-Exponent  Representation -> Can change the number of bits to represent Mantissa or Exponent as necessary -> All conversions at once -> Beautiful design  Download the app and start using now. :) ",
