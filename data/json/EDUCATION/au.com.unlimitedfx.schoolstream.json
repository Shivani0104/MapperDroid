Dynamic Categories customise your content to suit your schools needs  Every school is different and with School Streams Dynamic Categories functionality, teachers can tailor content based on the particular needs of their curriculum and subject areas.   Why does School Stream ask for permission to access photos, media, and other files?  School Stream does not access your photos or any other files.  When you install a new app on your device, the permissions use generic wording that relate to the need to read and write to your device storage.  To help speed up the app and make things faster, School Stream can use part of the storage built into your device to cache certain items and photos posted by your school. It also allows you to view information within School Stream when your device is offline.   Any questions, problems, or feedback?
