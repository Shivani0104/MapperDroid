"description" : "Litterati is an app that is empowering individuals to make a significant, measurable impact on the environment.  Far more than just picking up litter, the worldwide community of Litterati users are building the most powerful crowd-sourced set of data on litter ever assembled.  This data is being used to:  * Help cities better utilize their waste management services * Convince companies to change their operations to be more sustainable * Arm individuals and organizations with proof to create government policy changes  Litterati also shows you the map of your personal positive impact on the environment  You can join global cleanup challenges as well as create challenges in your community where your friends, family, neighbors, school system, or co-workers can join together to make your area healthy, clean, & beautiful.  This planet that we call home is a big place to keep clean. We all need to play our part.  Here is how the Litterati app works:  * Take a photo of each piece of litter that you collect and dispose of * Litterati will automatically geo-tag the photo for you * Our LitterAI tool will add tags to each litter photo for you to confirm or change * Upload the photos to the Litterati database * Track your personal impact as well as the total impact of the Litterati community  Join the global Litterati community today to be a part of over 150,000 people in over 116 countries around the world in the combined effort to clean up our planet!
