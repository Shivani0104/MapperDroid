"description" : "RMIT Campus Navigator has been created to guide you around campus.  At RMIT, we want you to get lost in new ideas, not lost on the grounds. Make a good impression by arriving to class on time with an app that allows you to locate specific tutorial rooms, lecture theatres, and computer labs, and helps you to access the fastest accessible routes to these spaces.  This app will get you wherever you need to be. Assessments due? Get the directions to study areas and silent study spaces. Stayed up late cramming for an exam? Find out the closest coffee shop to you. Gathering research? Gain access to library specific services such as book collections, where to borrow, where to return, and locating the help desk.  Additional features include directions to assistive areas/spaces; printers, copiers and scanners; and print credit recharge stations.  The application will provide Indoor turn-by-turn directions and location awareness for Study areas, Nearby Amenities, Printing/Scanning/Copying, Collections, books and many more across the Library.  The app will dynamically route you through lifts, stairs, corridors, and walk ways with GPS like directions within the library.   It has an easy to use and look & feel with a familiar layout. ",
