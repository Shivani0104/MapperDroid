Introspection is one of the most fundamental necessities of trying to understand who you are and what your place in the world is. It should be necessary to everyone to explain to themselves in a satisfactory manner a) why they believe in what they believe b) is there a possibility of them being completely and utterly wrong in their conclusions. In addition, being able to examine your own internal process from a non-involved vantage point while its happening is extremely helpful in creating a complete idea of your self-identity.  2. A sense of internal pluralism. The mental landscape of the human mind is not a singular thing, it can be best described as a debate by an inconsistent committee of contradictory opinions. I dare say that most people dont realize that they have more than one internal voice, especially since its considerably easier to go along with the conclusion of the most vocal one at any given time. Just recognizing the fact that you do indeed have, as it were, an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other, helps to give you a sense of who you really are. Just for clarification, Im not talking about hearing voices. Im talking about the fact that there are different parts in a persons mental make-up, otherwise there wouldnt be much sense in the idiom to argue with oneself or in the concept of self-doubt. The non-involved vantage point that I mentioned earlier basically means that a part of you notices when youre arguing with yourself and can observe the process.  3. Solipsism. For any of this to make sense, every adult person should have a satisfactory rational explanation as to why they can say that an external world beyond their own internal world exists in the first place. Without having done so, ones opinions on the external world seem rather pointless to begin with, so it is an essential foundation to build everything else on.  4. Relativism Once you start with introspection, and realize the possible fallacy that youre unwittingly committing by downplaying those of other people, you quickly run into the possibility that everything you think and believe might be utterly and completely wrong, or at least not as absolute as you previously thought. This usually results in either taking a healthier perspective regarding your own opinions or a full-blown existential crisis.  5. Existentialism A friend of mine once said that you cant really call yourself an adult before having dealt with the idea of existentialism, and I agree completely.
