One minute lessons Taking into account busyness of modern life, we designed each lesson in the way so it would never take more than one minute to complete it! So you no longer need to search for a free time to practice German! Simply, once you get a chance, launch app and do one lesson at a time =) Short sessions will not affect efficiency of word memorization.

Unlike others, we have only the most useful words, which are divided into 116 topic based lessons. Quality is here!  Teach-yourself German is design so it will use your visual and echoic memory to help you memorize German words fast and easy!  Special illustrations We use only specially developed info-graphics (developed by psychologists), so your eyes can quickly identify meaning of word or action without stressing them with small unnecessary details.  Word pronunciation by native speakers Our app will help you master pronunciation of German words! Each word is recording by professional native speaker! Additionally, in the settings you can choose between male or female voice.  Dynamic lesson difficulty The app changes lesson difficulty gradually as you progress. To achieve this, it keeps stats for EVERY word! Example: in the spelling mode, initially you need to insert several missing letters in a word, then create a word having extra letters and finally, when you are ready, you will need to type the entire word on the virtual keyboard.  Modes for quick learning App includes four additional lesson types which are made of favorites, difficult, old, random words. You can add any word to your favorite list and later create custom lesson from your favorites. Words are automatically added to difficult (the ones you struggle to memorize) and old (which you have not reviewed for a long time) sections. A random mode will create a unique lesson.  Additional features Thanks to your reviews, we are constantly updating app to make it better! To help you take care of your eyesight, with just one tap, you can activate night mode. If temporarily you do not have internet access, no problem! App can work offline as well!  Review Past Material Many good apps do not pay enough attention to review past material!
