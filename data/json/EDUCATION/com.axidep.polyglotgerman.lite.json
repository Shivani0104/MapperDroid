"description" : "Polyglot is an easy to use mobile manual of German Grammar.  You will learn to make simple sentences in German in a short time.  All you need is to spend 5-10 minutes a day learning.  In a week you will feel that you know some German.  Features:  Simple and intuitive interface  Pronunciation of German words and phrases  Integrated speech recognition for pronunciation exercises  No Internet connection required  No adverts or annoying popups  HOW IT WORKS  The program shows you simple sentences in English in one of the three forms (affirmative, negative, interrogative).   You have to translate the sentence into German using the words on the screen.  If your answer is right, the program will encourage you. If you are wrong, the program will show you the right answer.  While you are making the sentence, all the selected words are pronounced. Then the correct answer is read aloud.  If you have chosen a wrong word by mistake, push the Back button to cancel your choice.  The program creates a random sentence from the words in the dictionary. And it continues until you get bored.
