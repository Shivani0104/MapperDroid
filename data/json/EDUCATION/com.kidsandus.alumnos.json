Objectives and Benefits of My Locker: 1- To concentrate the digital educational resources related to the course in one place..  2- To facilitate families access to this content (audio, video, games).  3- To offer a wide variety of extra content to complement the students learning experience and to enable them to continue to have greater exposure to English outside the classroom.  Note: This app is available for all types of devices.  AUDIO TRACKS  In this section, families will have easy access to the audio tracks of the course. In addition, you will be able to download the tracks and listen to them without having to be connected to the Internet.  When its time to change tracks, you will receive a notification in the same app and the new audio will be automatically activated.   VIDEOS In this section, students will be able to watch cartoons which are suitable to their age.   GAMES  In this section, families will find several interactive games designed specifically for each character and story, so that the children can continue practising the vocabulary and structures learnt in the classroom activities at home. These games do not replace listening to the audio tracks of the story, but rather are a supplement. ",
