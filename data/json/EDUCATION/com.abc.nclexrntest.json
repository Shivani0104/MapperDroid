"description" : "The NCLEX-RN is given to determine a candidates ability to work as an entry-level nurse. It is a computer-adaptive test (CAT), which means each persons testing experience is different. The computer administers each question based on your performance on previous questions. Your questions will be appropriately challenging and at a level that the computer determines you have a 50% chance of answering correctly. You will continue to receive questions until the computer establishes that you have a 95% chance of achieving a passing score on the test, or until the time limit or the maximum number of questions is reached. The minimum number of questions is 75 and the maximum is 265. Of the items you are given, 15 of them are experimental questions that do not count toward the final score, but you will not know which ones these are. These are the categories and subcategories of NCLEX-RN test questions.
