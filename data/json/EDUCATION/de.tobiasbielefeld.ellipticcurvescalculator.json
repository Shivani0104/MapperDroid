"description" : "This is a simple app for calculating with elliptic curves.  Please note that this app is only designed to help you with your homework.  This app now calculates: -the addition of two points -the double and add algorithm -the order of a point -the order of a curve -ecdh and ecdsa  Features: -automaticly tests if the curve and points are valid (can be deactivated in the settings) -shows the detailed calculation steps -works with long integers ( max value 2-1 ) -low apk size, about 1.6 MB -does not need any permissions -no advertisments  Source code available here: https://github.com/TobiasBielefeld/Elliptic-Curves-Calculator ",
