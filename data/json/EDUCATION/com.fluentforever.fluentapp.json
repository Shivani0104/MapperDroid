"description" : "Never before have I seen a method that syncs up so perfectly with our current scientific understanding of how memory works. - Scientific American Mind  ................... WHAT IS FLUENT FOREVER? A revolutionary language learning method developed by Gabriel Wyner, an opera singer who needed to learn multiple languages quickly and retain them forever. Fluent Forevers products have evolved from pronunciation trainers into a bestselling book and now into the most crowdfunded app in history. Discover the immersive mobile experience designed to rewire your brain into fluently speaking any new language and hack your memory to remembering it forever. ................... HOW IS FLUENT FOREVER BETTER? Rather than distract or briefly entertaining you like other gamified language apps out there, Fluent Forever doesnt waste your time with inefficient bite size lessons - instead, it immediately gets you correctly pronouncing and hearing the sounds of your target language, then efficiently has you learn the most frequently used words and push them into your longterm memory, and finally has you naturally build sentences using words you know and practice your speech to fluency. In short, if youre serious about speaking a new language, Fluent Forever will get you there faster.  ................... FLUENT FOREVERS FOUR STEP METHOD The foundation of our proven method, as detailed in Gabes bestselling book, is based on the principles of personalized flashcard creation and spaced repetition, extremely powerful learning tools that optimize your brains memory abilities. So not only will you learn a language quickly, youll never forget it.  1. Train Your Ears With Pronunciation Lessons   You need to learn what a language sounds like before you can learn how to speak it. Our powerful tools like detailed instructional videos, mnemonic imagery and minimal pair tests will train your ears in the sound system of your new language.  2. Learn Vocabulary Through Images Instead of Translations  Within weeks you will understand the sounds of your new language, and you can begin learning words. By creating personalized flashcards using our memorable word association system, you will rapidly learn the most used words in your new language. You will then push these new words into your long term memory by reviewing your flashcards using our automated spaced repetition system.  3. Learn Grammar Naturally Through Stories Relevant To You  Once you learn the most used words in your language you can begin learning sentences. By visualizing how your new words fit into sentences about topics youre interested in, you will naturally learn grammar through immersive stories, as opposed to boring lessons or complex conjugation tables. You will never be forced to learn words or grammar you dont need or want to learn.  4. Practice Your Speech to Fluency with Native Tutors  Fluency in speech is not the ability to know every word and grammatical formation in a language; its the ability to use whatever words and grammar you know to say whatevers on your mind. Our method structures tutoring sessions efficiently using information youve learned, so that you dont waste an extra minute re-hashing something that you already discussed in a previous session. ................... LANGUAGES Spanish (Latin American & Castilian), French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, & Korean.  ...................
