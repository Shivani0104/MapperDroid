"description" : "Create graphs (simple, weighted, directed and/or multigraphs) and run algorithms step by step. Learn graph theory interactively... much better than a book!  27 algorithms to choose from (some of them are only available in the full version):  - Depth-first search (DFS) - Breadth-first search (BFS) - Count connected components (using BFS) - Greedy coloring - BFS coloring - Dijkstras algorithm (shortest path) - A*/A-star (shortest path, Euclidean distance) - DFS spanning tree - BFS spanning tree - Prims algorithm (minimum spanning tree) - Kruskals algorithm (minimum spanning tree/forest) - Bridge edges finding - Articulation points/cut vertices finding - Eulerian graph detection - Semi-Eulerian graph detection - Tarjans algorithm for strongly connected components in directed graphs - Tree detection - Bipartite graph detection - Complete graph detection - Tree center (unweighted graph) - Tree center (weighted graph) - Tree radius - Tree diameter - Tree node eccentricity - Tree centroid - Complement (inverse) graph - Fleurys algorithm (Eulerian cycles/paths in Eulerian and semi-Eulerian graphs)  ...and more to come!  Create a graph manually, or use the special graph creation tool to create one of the following graphs (some of them are only available in the full version):  - Cycle - Star - Wheel - Complete - Petersen - Herschel - Bipartite - Grtzsch - Platonic (Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Icosahedron, Dodecahedron) - Grid  Features:  - Dozens of graph algorithms to choose from in the full version - Step by step execution - Create simple graphs and multigraphs (only available in the full version) - Create weighted and unweighted graphs - Create directed and undirected graphs - Show/hide node degrees - Loop edges & multi-edges support - Custom node labels - Custom node radius - Custom edge weights - Detailed execution log for all available algorithms - Export graph as image to photo gallery - Export graph as SVG vector file - Save your graphs and load them later - Graph statistics (number of nodes, number of edges, node degrees, Eulerian, semi-Eulerian, connected components, adjacency list) - Pinch to zoom  Supported languages:  - English - Spanish ",
