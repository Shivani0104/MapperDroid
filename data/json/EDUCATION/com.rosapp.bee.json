"description" : "The one and only educational application about bees and pollinators. Entertains and teaches children how significant and essential for the ecosystem honeybees and other pollinators are. Over 3/4 plant species grown in Europe grows due to pollinating insects work. Unfortunately, for several years their population decreases very quickly. Many fruits and vegetables are about to disappear forever from the Earth.  The good news is - we can all do things to help ensure the survival of the bees!  Only environmental education from an early age can help change this situation. Children who play the Bee application learn what the life of honey bees looks like, what are the roles in the beehive, how and why they produce honey and the most important: what we can do to protect wild pollinators, for example, learn how to build houses and what to plant in gardens.  Additionally, we have prepared a quiz with questions, where children can evaluate their knowledge. The application has been tested on children aged 4-10, and every child found something interesting in it.  Lets save the bees!  +++ THE ADVANTAGES OF THE APP+++  * it teaches through playing - this is the best way for children to acquire knowledge, * Lector Adele adds curiosities about the life of bees, * knowledge evaluation quiz, * the application may be used by teachers in lessons, in kindergartens and schools.
