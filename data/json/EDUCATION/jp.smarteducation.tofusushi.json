Be bold and pile up fish and wasabi if you want to.  - In the Roll kitchen, fire the topping bazooka and spray the sushi fillings on the bed of rice. You can go super fat of super skinny, any way you want it.  - In the Gunkan kitchen, top as much fish, meat, candy and popcorn as you wish. You can even take photos and use them as sushi toppings, too. - Now, lets have the guests eat your creation. Look forward to their reactions! - There are no rules in this sushi bar. Be bold, silly and unique!  After all, what child doesnt like playing with food? We hope decorating their own sushi in a fun atmosphere will help them grow their imagination. Itadakimasu! ",
