"description" : "Scan Ben & Bella illustrations with the innovative Ben & Bella  Treasure Box app and simultaneously hear the spoken vocabulary word of this image. This way young children can create their own audiovisual English dictionary of more than 300 key words.  Many Ben & Bella illustrations also trigger animated cartoons, audio-books, songs and wonderful sing-and-dance videos to sing and dance along. All are narrated or sung by native English speakers. These not only entertain children but familiarize them with spoken English in no time.  Make learning a multi sensory experience for your child. By scanning many illustrations you will also receive coloring templates which you can print for your child to color. Upon coloring your child can also scan these images and will receive more vocabulary words.  Heres how the app works:   1. You can register within the app to make sure your content remains yours, even when switching devices.  2. With your camera activated by the Ben & Bella  Treasure Box app, your child can start scanning images from all the Ben & Bella storybooks, sticker books, flashcards, activity books or from wherever he/she finds new Ben & Bella images.
