"description" : "LEAF Smart Community is a communication platform dedicated to the customers of community, residential, condo, apartment and commercial building to create a safe, harmonious and environmentally friendly community.  We help to solve the following problems:  1. Communication between community residents and administrators, security guards , and volunteers.  2. Recruitment of voluntary team members 3. The safety of elderly as well as young children  4. Conveniently search for the businesses / shops around the community  Neighborhood assistance: We are all aware of it. But how do we put those words into action? With the working life that suffer late working hours, thus unable to say even a simple hello to the neighbors. The problems of home alone senior citizens have become more severe, for example: Getting lost in the neighborhood, fell and injured at home. There will not be anyone around to help the elderly whenever unexpected circumstances occur. LEAF would like to take this platform to improve the system within the community by getting the neighborhood together.  LEAFs 5 main functions:   1. Communications To support households and residents, enabling free text chat and voice intercom, share pictures , receive and sending community updates and new. In a specific community column, the residents can post and share news feeds regarding anything and get to know one another from other communities nearby.   2. Community and home security Community CCTVs can be viewed at anytime and with mobile emergency button, you can instantly link to family members and neighbors, administrators, and securities in the desperate need of help. Furthermore, location sharing function can help keep track the location of the elderly and children. You can also link the home alarm system to our LEAF server. Thus when the alarm is triggered, the security will be alerted and immediate action will be taken. The alarm will also be synced to close ones. With this, notification time can be reduced to minimum.   3. Community Management Community bulletin allows managers to publish updates regarding the buildings statuses to residents with no delay. Not only that but it also supports two-way communication whereby residents can always keep in contact with management personnel , watch community bulletin or community meeting records and communicate via local social networking. Besides, residents can also make reservations for public facilities such as gym, swimming pool and tennis court. They can also check the availabilities and make online bookings.  4. Access Management. Visitors can make advanced reservations with the residents. Upon arrival, they can have access into the compound through QR Code. The security will be notified and keep records of the visitors identities via the guardroom computer. This is so that the registration procedures and individual visitor identification can be avoided thus saving time.   5. Businesses Surrounding The Communities LEAF supports online registrations for neighboring businesses. This way, residents can directly contact with the shops respectively so that they are able to obtain updates regarding the information of the latest products in the specifically selected outlets, make bookings and appointments with only a call away. This would be extremely fun and convenient.
