"description" : "Send a printed photo album to your parents or grandparents every month. Add your favorite photos and invite other family members to add their pictures. We print and deliver your album to your recipients doorstep. More than 100,000 families have already created their photo albums. Why dont you?   How it works  - Download our app and create your account - Add your photos to the album: You can add pictures until the last day of each month - Add captions to your photos: not mandatory, but it adds a nice touch to your album ;-) - Ask your family to participate: brothers, sisters... Invite anyone who could add great pictures - Pick a plan that suits you best and submit your photo album  On the last day of every month, we collect all the albums and automatically format, print and ship your albums. From now on, all you need to do is add your photos and captions and remind your family members to do the same. Youre all set!    Why create a family photo album  At Neveo, we believe that photos build family ties. Theres proof: everyone loves looking at their photo albums to remember all the good times.  But we also know that life gets busy and we often dont take the time to print photos (of our children, our trips...) and send them to our parents. The Neveo family album is the best way to share your favorite moments with your family. Seeing your amazing memories printed out in a real photo album is magical.    Why choose Neveo  1) Because were a nice bunch ;-) 2) Because our app is super easy to use 3) Because were meticulous about the quality of your album 4) Because with us you can cancel anytime for free 5) Because we regularly remind you to add your photos to make sure youre loved ones dont miss out   Who we are    We come from very different backgrounds, but we all noticed the same thing: we let ourselves get caught up in our jobs and daily routines without taking the time to share important moments in our lives with our loved ones. The idea of creating a simple way to send photos to our parents and grandparents is what brought us together. So we designed and developed Neveo as a way to easily recreate the photo albums that we all know from our childhood.  Were passionate about our cause and hope that it will help more families reconnect with each other through their photos. Your satisfaction is extremely important to us, which is why you can always reach us at hello@neveo.com. We make sure to get back to you within 24 hours. You can also get in touch through our chat.
