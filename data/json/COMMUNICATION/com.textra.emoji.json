"description" : "This is an *add-on* to the Textra SMS application that utilizes iOS styled emojis in preference to the phones system emoji style.   Provides 3000+ of the latest (Unicode 12.1) emojis including diversity (skin tone) on any Android phone.  You access the emojis using the + icon to the left of the message field in the conversation. Long hold on a human skin emoji (for example a hand gesture) to see diversity (skin tone color) options.  IMPORTANT: These emoji are ONLY available in the Textra SMS app. They are not available system wide (e.g. your keyboard app).   iOS is a trademark of Apple Inc ",
