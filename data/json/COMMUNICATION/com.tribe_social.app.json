"description" : "Tribe Social allows you to stay connected with friends and co-workers without the rest of the world getting in your way.  Each tribe is your very own secure, invitation-only, private activity stream, where you can share files and have discussions in the same great ways that youve become accustomed to on public social networks. Without all the friend requests, birthday reminders, and event invites to get in your way.  Tribes are a great place for close friends to keep in touch, co-workers to collaborate on projects, or professionals to learn. Any communication that deserves privacy deserves a tribe.  With robust analytics built in, you can keep track of what your tribe is talking about and turn those insights into action. See which members of your tribe are the most active, what the popular topics are, and when your tribe members are the most engaged. Conversations are great, but being able to learn from them is better. ",
