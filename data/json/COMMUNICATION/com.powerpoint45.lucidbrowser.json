"description" : "Lucid Browser is a free and open source web browser designed to be small, light, fast, and simple. The app itself is as small as about 4 MB, and the Donate version is only about 2 MB. The browser uses a custom homepage that loads locally for quick start-ups. Although it is small in size, it packs a punch with all the features you would normally see in a mobile browser. For example, you can import bookmarks from other browsers that use file formats of HTML or JSON. The browser also allows for complete management of bookmarks with folder categorization. By default, Lucid Browser uses Ecosia, a project designed to help plant trees. Lucid Browser also comes with many settings and ways to personalize the look. It is easy to use, very handy, and allows you to surf the net with speed.
