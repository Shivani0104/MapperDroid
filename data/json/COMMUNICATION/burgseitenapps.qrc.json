"description" : "QRChat allows you to hook up with people without giving out any of your private contact information.  TEAM UP: You have to collaborate with people, but dont want to share your private information with them or add them as friends on social media? That is exactly what QRChat is for! Sign up, create a room and share the QR code with all peers, colleagues or acquaintances that should join the room.  PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY: There is no need to share any personal information with the people in the chatroom. No one sees more than your chosen nickname and avatar. Also, you dont have to give out any personal information to create an account in the first place.  CHAT ENCRYPTED: All communication is encrypted and can only be decrypted by room members:  Every message gets symmetrically encrypted before it leaves the device. Only people in the same chatroom are able to decrypt the messages since they received the key directly via the QR Code. The keys are created, stored and exchanged offline (except the user shares the QR code via the internet).  GET STARTED:  Sign up anonymously and free  Create or join a chat room  Share the QR code with people  Send and receive encrypted messages ",
