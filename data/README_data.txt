You may visualize these JSON files using any of these online JSON parsers:

Note:- 

1. It is possible that a few initial JSON files may have a comma misplaced around attribute ext_perms. This is a result of early automation scripts and will be fixed. 
2. Since the number of files is large for some app categories, JSON file listing may be truncated on the web site. Therefore, you should clone or download entire directory.
